# card-capture

A solo deckbuilder, using a single deck of standard playing cards.

Card Capture is a relatively simple introduction to the Deck Building genre using a standard deck of 54 playing cards.

Players start with the smallest cards in the deck and slowly use them to purchase higher-valued cards, while at the same time strategically thinning their draw decks and avoiding the capture of their own valuable cards.
